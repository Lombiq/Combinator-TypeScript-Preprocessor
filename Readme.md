# Combinator TypeScript Preprocessor Readme



## Project Description

TypeScript preprocessor for the Combinator Orchard module (https://github.com/Lombiq/Combinator).  
This preprocessor hooks into [Combinator](https://github.com/Lombiq/Combinator) and compiles you included TypeScript files (.ts files) into pure JavaScript.


## Documentation

**The module is dependent on the [Combinator](https://github.com/Lombiq/Combinator)  and [Javascript.NET](https://github.com/Lombiq/Orchard-JavaScript.Net) Orchard modules, so make sure to install them first!**

This preprocessor hooks into Combinator and compiles included TypeScript files (.ts files) into pure JavaScript.
Compiler logic taken from: [https://github.com/giggio/TypeScriptCompiler](https://github.com/giggio/TypeScriptCompiler).
